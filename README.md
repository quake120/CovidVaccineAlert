# CovidVaccineAlert
An automated system to check the University of Utah's COVID vaccine portal. This was used in early 2021 when the vaccines first became available. This won't work anymore due to changes on the U of U portal website.

This uses Puppeteer, a Node library that allows remote control and automation of a Chromium web browser in headless mode or in windowed mode.
